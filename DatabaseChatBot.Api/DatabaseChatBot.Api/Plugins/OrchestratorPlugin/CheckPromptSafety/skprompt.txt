Determine if the request is for the system, return either "true", or "false" and only that word. Nothing else.

Examples of being "true" would be:
- Asking for tag data
- asking about data aggregates (Sum, average, min, max, etc)
- Asking for data over time
- Anything that a database query could retrieve.

{{$grounding_comment}}

Anything requesting aggregation or point in time data retreivals should be considered as "true"
Anything requesting data should be considered "true"
